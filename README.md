#### Extracting all links (including “href” and “text”) from a webpage using Node.js and 2 packages: got and cheerio.

   * "got" is an easy-to-use and powerful HTTP request library for Node.js that will help download HTML from a webpage.
   
   ### npm i got or yarn add got 
   <br>
   ### // const got = require("got");

   * "cheerio" is a fast implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server that can help us parse HTML much easier.

   ### npm i cheerio or yarn add cheerio 
   <br>
   ### // const cheerio = require("cheerio");
